Contained within this repository is my 2nd assignment completed as part of the web development module I have undertaken at Dublin City University.

The exmaples I have programmed are to show my understanding of Javascript an apply what I have learend to complete the following tasks:

Example one:

JavaScript that prompts the user for a positive 2 digit integer. When the user presses Submit, the program will use a JavaScript function to validate the user input and:
•	determine and render to the webpage all odd numbers from 0 to the user’s input (inclusive) in CSV (comma-separated values) format
•	determine and render to the webpage all even numbers from 0 to the user’s input (inclusive) in CSV format

For example, if the user enters 20, the webpage will display the following information:

Even numbers: 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
Odd numbers: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19

Example two: 

Created a webpage using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript to do the following: 

• Prompt the user to choose the row-column size of a matrix from a drop-down list of three sizes (3x3, 5x5, 7x7). 
• The chosen size should is passed as a parameter to a JavaScript function which uses this size to generate the correct number of rows and columns for the matrix. 
• The code will then render a matrix of the chosen size. Every cell will be rendered as a circle. Every even cell on every even row will then be rendered in yellow.
• Internal CSS is used to style the matrix.
